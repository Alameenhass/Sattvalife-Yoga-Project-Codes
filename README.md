SattvaLife Web Project — Code Pack

A small, safe set of changes for a live WordPress site. The focus is trust (Google Reviews), clear choices (Retreats and Programmes), and tidy, consistent UI. This pack contains drafts and snippets that were used to build and test the changes.

What’s inside

Header & Footer Draft Code.docx
Header and footer templates for a simple, centred layout with clear navigation and two quick actions. Includes a small mobile drawer and a “Get in Touch” and “Google Maps” shortcut.

Home Page Draft Code 2.docx
Home page markup and styles. Includes hero copy, a “Welcome” card, a two-location timetable, a “Find What Feels Good” section, blogs, right-side page nav, and a “Back to top” control.

Our Programs Page Draft 2.docx
“Our Programmes” page with switchable panels for Groups, Online, Retreats, and Corporate. Includes features grids, scrollable steps, retreat pricing cards, a small contact form, and matching side nav.

About us Page Draft Code 2.5.docx
Draft markup for the About page to host the full reviews widget and supporting copy.

Additional Css Code 2.docx
Shared tokens and helpers (radius, spacing, shadows, cards, focus styles) to keep pages visually consistent and reduce layout shifts.

Reviews php code.docx
A WordPress plugin shortcode that fetches Google reviews, caches them for 60 minutes, and renders a simple horizontal scroller with a “Find us on Google Maps” link.
Important: do not commit live API keys. Replace any hard-coded key with a server-side constant, for example define('SL_GOOGLE_KEY', 'your-key');, and reference it in code.

Scraping_try_1.ipynb
A one-off notebook used during early experiments. Not required for the live site.
